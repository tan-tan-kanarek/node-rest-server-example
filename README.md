# node-rest-server-example
## Very simple REST server example in node.js

This server example is fully functional, however, it's lacking few important features.
 - Authentication
 - Authorization
 - Logging
 - Proper DB implementation (I tried to keep it simple)
 - Simple file upload example
 - Simple file download example
